## Reaction Time Analysis Under Multisensory Distractions

This project investigates how hand dominance, visual distractions, and auditory distractions affect human reaction time in a color-change response task. A blocked factorial design was used to collect response time data under 12 treatment combinations across three lighting conditions.

Key findings:
- Visual (`p = 0.003`) and auditory (`p = 0.048`) distractions significantly slowed reaction time.
- Fastest response (~241 ms) occurred under dim lighting with no distractions.
- ANOVA was used to analyze main effects and interactions; model assumptions were validated using Box-Cox transformation, residual diagnostics, and half-normal plots.
- Results were visualized and interpreted using R.
